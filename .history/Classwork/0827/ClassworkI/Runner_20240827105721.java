    // In a loop, have 4 options.  
    // Option 1 is to use a loop to display all the names and corresponding company info of the ArrayList of Pairs using the toString() of the generic pair.  
    // Option 2 is to ask the user for a company name.  You can then change the stockPrice of that company.  That information would be reflected when you print the ArrayList of Pairs using Option 1.   
    // Option 3 is to have the ability to add a new company. (Hint: You may want to keep a list of all the companies.)
    // Option 4 is to be able to select a user and replace a company with another company.  (We will assume the user knows the company name.)
    // Option 5 is to quit.
