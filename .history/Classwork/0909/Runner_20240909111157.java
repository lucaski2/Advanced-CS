//Use your own MyArrayList. Create a list of 1,000 random numbers from 0-99.  Print out the list on one line with each number separated by a comma utilizing your MyArrayList toString().  Sort it using bubble sort (link).  Print the list again.   Count how many passes it took.  This means to have a counter variable and increase it in the inner loop.

In a loop that runs 1000 times, pick a random index in your MyArrayList  to the size.  Remove that index. For each removal, print the index and the number removed.
